Smart Room System - IoT application

Application for exercise of my IoT course at university.

In this app:
- I used Unity to build an application.
- This app will get data from server which gets data from IoT sensors.
- User can use this app to control devices in IoT system (lights, fans, etc ..).
- User can also set up time to automatically turn on or off devices.
- This app also has alert system which will show warning if there is something wrong (temp is too high/low ...).
